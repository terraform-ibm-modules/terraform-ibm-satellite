# IBM Cloud Satellite Module

Use this terrafrom automation to set up satellite location on IBM cloud.
It will provision satellite location and create 6 VSIs and assign 3 host to control plane, and provision ROKS satellite cluster and auto assign 3 host to cluster,
Configure cluster worker pool to an existing ROKS satellite cluster.

This is a collection of sub modules that make it easier to provision a satellite on IBM Cloud.
* location
* host
* cluster
* configure-cluster-worker-pool

## Overview

IBM CloudÂ® Satellite helps you deploy and run applications consistently across all on-premises, edge computing and public cloud environments from any cloud vendor. It standardizes a core set of Kubernetes, data, AI and security services to be centrally managed as a service by IBM Cloud, with full visibility across all environments through a single pane of glass. The result is greater developer productivity and development velocity.

## Features

- Create satellite location.
- Create 6 VSIs with RHEL 7.9.
- Assign the 3 hosts to the location control plane.
- *Conditional creation*:
  * Create a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster and assign the 3 hosts to the cluster, so that you can run OpenShift workloads in your location.
  * Configure a worker pool to an existing OpenShift Cluster.

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.13 or later.

## Note

* `location` module creates new location or use existing location ID/name. If user pass the location which is already exist,   satellite-location module will error out and exit the module. In such cases user has to set `is_location_exist` value to true. So that module will use existing location for processing.
* All optional fields are given value `null` in varaible.tf file. User can configure the same by overwriting with appropriate values.
* 'satellite-location' module download attach host script in the home directory and appends respective permissions to the script.
* The modified script must be used in the `user_data` attribute of VSI instance
* If we want to make use of a particular version of module, then set the argument "version" to respective module version.

## Pre-commit Hooks

Run the following command to execute the pre-commit hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file

  `pre-commit run -a`

We can install pre-coomit tool using

  `pip install pre-commit`

## How to input varaible values through a file

To review the plan for the configuration defined (no resources actually provisioned)

`terraform plan -var-file=./input.tfvars`

To execute and start building the configuration defined in the plan (provisions resources)

`terraform apply -var-file=./input.tfvars`

To destroy the VPC and all related resources

`terraform destroy -var-file=./input.tfvars`

All optional parameters by default will be set to null in respective example's varaible.tf file. If user wants to configure any optional paramter he has overwrite the default value.
