# IBM Cloud Satellite module

Use this Terraform automation to set up a Satellite location on IBM CloudÂ®. The module provisions the IBM Cloud Satellite location, creates 6 VSIs, assigns three hosts to the control plane, provisions a ROKS Satellite cluster, assigns three hosts to the cluster, and configures a cluster worker pool to an existing ROKS Satellite cluster.

This module is a collection of submodules that make it easier to provision Satellite resources on IBM Cloud.

- location
- host
- cluster
- configure-cluster-worker-pool

## Overview

IBM Cloud Satellite helps you deploy and run applications consistently across all on-premises, edge computing, and public cloud environments from any cloud vendor. It standardizes a core set of Kubernetes, data, AI, and security services to be centrally managed as a service by IBM Cloud, with full visibility across all environments through a single pane of glass. The result is greater developer productivity and development velocity.

## Features

- Creates Satellite location.
- Creates 6 VSIs with RHEL 7.9.
- Assigns the three hosts to the location control plane.
- *Conditionally creates* these items:
    - Create a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster and assign the three hosts to the cluster so that you can run Red Hat OpenShift workloads in your location.
    - Configure a worker pool to an existing Red Hat OpenShift Cluster.

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.13 or later.

## Note

- The `location` submodule creates a location or uses an existing location ID or name.
- All optional fields are set to `null` in the `variables.tf` file. You can override the values.
- The `location` submodule downloads the attached host script to the home directory and appends permissions to the script. Use the modified script in the `user_data` attribute of VSI instance.
- If you want to use a particular version of a module, set the argument `version` to the module version.

## Pre-commit Hooks

- Run the following command to execute the pre-commit hooks that are defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

    ```bash
    pre-commit run -a`
    ```

- You can install the pre-commit tool by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit`
    ```

## How to input variable values through a file

- To review the plan for the configuration defined (no resources are provisioned), run the following command.

    ```hcl
    terraform plan -var-file=./input.tfvars`
    ```

- To execute and start building the configuration that is defined in the plan (provision resources), run the following command:

    ```hcl
    terraform apply -var-file=./input.tfvars`
    ```

- To destroy the VPC and all related resources, run the following command:

    ````hcl
    terraform destroy -var-file=./input.tfvars`
    ```

All optional parameters are set to null by default in the example's `variables.tf` file. If you want to configure an optional parameter, override the default value.
